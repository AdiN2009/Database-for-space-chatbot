# Database-for-space-chatbot
Hey there, in the Description I have provided a intents.json file. I would like If you could contribute patterns(questions), and responses(Answers), about anything in space. Honestly just add 2 or 3 of them and they could be a big amount of help. Creating these tags and providing the questions and answers can make the chatbot database more stronger
