# Database-for-space-chatbot
Hey there, in the Description I have provided an intents.json file. I would like it If you could contribute patterns(questions), and responses(Answers), about anything in space. Honestly just add 2 or 3 of them and they could be a big amount of help. Creating these tags and providing the questions and answers can make the chatbot database stronger.

What you need to do is choose a topic about space. E.g. the age of the Earth, the moon's dimensions, how nebulaes are formed etc. Just remember it must be related to space! Another thing is that you should add more than one pattern(question) so that there can be various ways to ask this question. Correspond these questions in the same order for the responses(Answers) section, so that It can provide accurate results. You can fix code but do not delete anything for no apparent reason. Here are some examples below:

{"tag": "Earth fun facts!",
"patterns": ["Tell me a fun fact about Earth", "Cool facts about Earth", "Can you tell me a fact about earth", "Tell me something cool about Earth","Anything you know cool about Earth", "Fun facts about the Earth", "Tell me a ranodm fact about the Earth", "More fun facts about the Earth", "Tell me something else more cool about the Earth", "What other cool facts you know about the Earth"],
